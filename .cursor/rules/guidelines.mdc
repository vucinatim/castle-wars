# Tooling
- Use pnpm for package manager
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use Shadcn UI for components
- Use React for the frontend
- Use TypeScript for everything
- Use Vite or Next.js for the build
- Use ESLint for linting
- Use Prettier for formatting
- Use zustand for state management
- Use zod for validation
- Use react-hook-form for form handling
- Use tanstack-query for data fetching
# Conventions
- Use camelCase for variables
- Use PascalCase for components
- Use kebab-case for files
- Use "const ComponentName = (props: Props) => {}" for components (not React.FC or function component)
- Do NOT use index.ts files for aggregating multiple exports
- Do NOT pass props when they can be accessed through a zustand store or a provider context
# Refactoring
- When extracting components:
    - Create a new file in the components folder if the component is reused across multiple files
    - Write the component in the same file if the component is only used in one file
# Tips
- When writing tool / util functions use JSDoc to add a description and maybe example if needed (without @param and @returns)
- Use tsc for typechecking.
# Notes
- We are using a monorepo with pnpm and vite and next.js
- Shared package is used to share schemas and types between the packages
- We are using R2 for cloud storage
- We are using postgres with drizzle for the database
# Instructions
- Always use the latest version of the libraries and tools - by installing them with pnpm
- Write clean, readable, logical, structured, extensible and maintainable codebase.
- NEVER think or design for backwards compatibility! Always rewrite and change all usages in code to the new system.
